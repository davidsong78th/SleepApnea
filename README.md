# Sleep Apnea Detection Device 

Sleep Apnea is a sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly and temporarily stops. 

Currently available sleep apnea detection devices are expensive and complicated for non-medical users.

## Main Goals

- Design a low-cost sleep apnea detection device capable of continuous, long-term monitoring
- Design a smart phone app that can display the user's sleep study data collected through the detection device
- Incorporate Bluetooth connectivity between device and smart phone

## Features

- Software will include separate displays for both the clinician and patient. 
- Long term data storage will be on the cloud.
- Will display polysomnography records using data collected from the sensors.
